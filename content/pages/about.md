Hi, I'm Saugat Rimal, a [web designerðŸš€developer](https://www.saugatreemal.engineer/) focused on crafting great web experiences. I am a self taught developer, FOSS lover, linux enthusiast. I have always loved creating something out of nothing. When I was little I started with photography, moved on to digital marketing, and then I found the digital world where it was possible to create anything! I started creating anything and everything; games, 2D Animation, softwares and websites. Now I like building new stuff and work with other people â€“ nothing really interesting is ever built alone!  Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at an digital agency, a start-up, and as freelancer. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at [Hyburtech](https://hyburtech.com/) for a variety of clients.

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:

*   Css3
*   Html5
*   JavaScript (ES6+)
*   React
*   Gatsby
*   Bootstrap
*   SEO
*   C Programming
*   Ghost
*   Linux
*   Node.js
*   WordPress
*   WooCommerce
*   Git & Github
*   Vercel

*Thank You for reading!*
