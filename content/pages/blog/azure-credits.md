## Step-by-step Instructions of Getting an AWS Educate Account:&#xA;

**Step 1.** Visit <https://course.genesecloud.academy/login/signup.php>, and create an account! Also, confirm your e-mail, and then login to your account!

**Step 2.** Visit <https://course.genesecloud.academy/course/view.php?id=19>, and then enrol into the course!

**Step 3.** Send an e-mail with the following e-mail template to [**contact@genesecloud.academy**](mailto:contact@genesecloud.academy) with the E-mail Subject being "**Regarding AWS Educate credits!**":

Hello sir/madam,

I am **{Your_Name}**, from **{Your_Place}**. I am a student of **{Your_Course_or_Study_Level}** at **{School/College/University_Name_and_Place}**. I am highly enthusiastic about cloud computing and **{Your_Field_of_Interest}**.

I heard from my friend that you offer AWS Educate credits worth $100 to students who are willing to begin their journey into cloud computing. For this purpose, I am sending this e-mail to you.

I would like to request you to invite me to AWS Educate with the AWS Educate cloud credits.

I have already created an account at **Genese Cloud Academy** as a Student, and also enrolled into the "**Getting an AWS Educate Account**" course there. My username at **Genese Cloud Academy** is **{Your_Username_defined_in_Step\_1}**.

I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks,

**{Your_Name}**

**Step 4.** Wait for an e-mail from one of the representatives of **Genese Cloud Academy**, and follow the instructions (*if any*) mentioned in the response e-mail!

**Step 5.** If there are no instructions to follow, you will also receive an e-mail from AWS Educate saying you have been invited to AWS Educate. Now, you can click on the hyperlink mentioned in the e-mail, and then create your AWS Educate account.

**Step 6.** After the completion of **Step 5**, you will have to confirm your e-mail when you receive a confirmation e-mail from AWS Educate.

**Step 7.** Now, when you confirm your e-mail address, you will have to wait for a while for the AWS Educate team to review your account. This process shall take some time ranging from few minutes to several hours; generally it shouldn't take more than two hours.

**Step 8.** After **Step 7** is completed, and you receive an e-mail saying your AWS Educate account has been approved, then you can visit <https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/>, and then sign in to your AWS Educate account.

**Step 9.** When you sign in to your AWS Educate account for the first time, you might need to accept the **Terms of Service**. After you accept it, you can create your **AWS Educate Starter Account**. This step has to be performed during the first time you login to your AWS Educate account.

**Step 10.** Now, you can start using AWS Educate with your $100 worth of cloud credits.

## How to use AWS Educate Starter Account?

When you want to use your AWS Educate Starter Account, you can perform the following steps:

1.  First, visit <https://www.awseducate.com/student/s/>,

2.  Then, sign in to your account,

3.  Now, click on "[**AWS Account**](https://www.awseducate.com/student/s/awssite)",

4.  Then, click on "[**AWS Educate Starter Account**](https://www.awseducate.com/student/s/launch-starter)", which will send you to <https://labs.vocareum.com/>,

5.  Click on "**AWS Console**" in the **Vocareum Workbench** to authenticate to your AWS account through AWS Educate!

With all of these steps being performed, you can start your journey into the AWS cloud, experiencing the services provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## What to do if my $100 credits are exhausted?

When you finish your $100 worth of cloud credits, you will be given more $20 credits for a few days so that you can take a backup of your cloud resources. After the completion of this time period, the access to your **AWS Educate Starter Account** will be prohibited, and from this time period, your [AWS Educate Account Dashboard](https://www.awseducate.com/student/s/awssite) will start saying "*Your starter account is no longer active.*".

## Can I renew my AWS Educate account?

When your AWS Educate cloud credits are totally consumed, and your extra $20 credits for a certain period of time is also exhausted, then you will have to wait until next year (from the time period that you got invitation to AWS Educate), and then AWS Educate will provide you the option to renew your AWS Educate account.

## Thank You!
