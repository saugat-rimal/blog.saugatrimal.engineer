Behind a mission to make cloud computing accessible to everyone, [Zeit](https://zeit.co/) promises zero-configuration static hosting that integrates with a variety of web frameworks. By installing the command line interface, users can publish and deploy in just a few keystrokes.

## [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)

![](https://www.errorto200.codes/content/images/2021/06/image-17.png)

The Gatsby Cloud hosting service was created by the Gatsby team itself. As such, it’s designed to support the best parts of the platform.

You may prefer this host if you want to keep all of the tools you use to build and support your site in the same company. This gives you access to across-the-board support. Additionally, the plans focus on traffic, making it helpful if you have intentions to scale up.

The main attraction of this host may be how it’s optimized to work with Gatsby on the whole. However, it also has other stand-out features, such as:

⚙️ **Features:**

*   The delivery of all static web assets on a powerful [content delivery network (CDN)](https://themeisle.com/blog/content-delivery-network-for-wordpress/) to handle any traffic spikes and improve global performance

*   Intelligent image caching and incremental builds for quick-loading interfaces

*   A combination of both [local development](https://themeisle.com/blog/web-design-and-development-difference/) and cloud-based tools

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

## ![](https://www.hostingadvice.com/images/uploads/2019/12/firebase.jpg?width=300\&height=84)

With the powerful backing and oversight of Google, [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) gives mobile and web application developers tons of tools to move quickly online. Users can run static or dynamic sites on Google’s SSD-powered infrastructure, with built-in analytics, performance monitoring, and crash reporting tools to help site owners optimize and perfect their site. Google further expanded its static hosting footprint in 2015 by snatching up [DivShot](https://divshot.com/), another popular brand in the free hosting space.

*   **Number of sites:** Multiple websites within a single Firebase project

*   **Storage and bandwidth:** 1GB storage and 10GB bandwidth per month

*   **Domains:** Custom domain name or subdomains on web.app and firebaseapp.com domains

*   **Key features:** Zero-configuration SSL certificates, global CDN, A/B testing, and analytics

[Forge](https://getforge.com/)

## ![](https://www.hostingadvice.com/images/uploads/2019/12/forge.jpg?width=300\&height=102)

Billed as the fastest, simplest, and most affordable way to host and deploy static websites, [Forge](https://getforge.com/) takes publishing beyond GitHub or the command line interface by including built-in Dropbox compatibility. The user-friendly platform includes a drag-and-drop interface for file syncing, as well as TurboJS and content delivery network integration to optimize page load speeds. Bandwidth restrictions make the free plan tough to stay in for the long haul, but we love that Forge comes with 24/7 support.

*   **Number of sites:** Unlimited publishing on one project

*   **Storage and bandwidth:** 5GB of storage and 1GB bandwidth per month

*   **Domains:** Custom domains supported

*   **Key features:** Hosted forms, .htaccess rewrites and redirects, plus live site previews
