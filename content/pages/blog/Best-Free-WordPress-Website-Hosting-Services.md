> Is free website hosting any good? Well, ‚Äúfree‚Äù is always good, but not always worth it in the long run. 

**Let me explain:**

In short, if you want to run a test website, you‚Äôre not expecting much of it, and you don‚Äôt want to invest any money in the project at all, then free website hosting might indeed work for you!

## **Ten best free website hosting services compared**

The good news is that you can test drive free website hosting at no cost to see if it might work for you. If you‚Äôve decided to give it a try, here are ten options to consider.

*   [InfinityFree](https://infinityfree.net/)

*   [Wix](https://www.wix.com/)

*   [000WebHost](https://www.000webhost.com/)

*   [Google Cloud Hosting](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/web-hosting)

*   [AwardSpace](https://www.awardspace.com/)

*   [Freehostia](https://www.freehostia.com/)

*   [FreeHosting](https://www.freehosting.com/)

*   [ByetHost](https://byet.host/)

*   [HyperPHP](http://hyperphp.com/)

*   [FreeWebHostingArea](https://www.freewebhostingarea.com/)

*   [FreeHostingnoads](https://freehostingnoads.net/)

*   [Googiehost](https://googiehost.com/)

### 1. InfinityFree

![](https://mllj2j8xvfl0.i.optimole.com/Lsv2lkg.axYo~36f5d/w:713/h:344/q:98/https://s15165.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/infinityfree-2.png)

[InfinityFree](https://infinityfree.net/)¬†is a free hosting initiative powered by¬†[iFast Net](https://ifastnet.com/). It offers users:

*   An autoinstaller with more than 400 different applications, including WordPress

*   Free subdomains

*   Unlimited storage

*   Unlimited bandwidth

*   400 MySQL databases

*   Knowledgebase support

You‚Äôll have access to the Softaculous Script Installer to install WordPress. This hosting service doesn‚Äôt offer domain registration, but you can use one you‚Äôve acquired from¬†[another registrar](https://themeisle.com/blog/best-domain-registrars/).

Once your website is published, your visitors won‚Äôt see ads. However, there will be ads in cPanel on the back end. Your site is also limited to 50,000 hits per day.

2.¬†[Wix](https://themeisle.com/blog/go/wix-free-hosting-plan/)

### ![](https://mllj2j8xvfl0.i.optimole.com/Lsv2lkg.axYo~36f5d/w:713/h:334/q:98/https://s15165.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Wix4.jpg)

Wix is a website builder. However, we‚Äôre featuring it on this list because it‚Äôs kind of an all-in-one solution for both a website platform and server space to host that website. Since Wix does come with a free plan, this makes it a free website hosting service as well. Wix is a unique way to enjoy awesome site-building features backed by enterprise-grade reliability. On that free plan, you get:

*   Wix.com subdomain

*   Beautiful templates

*   500 MB disk space

*   500 MB bandwidth

*   Global content delivery network

*   Free SSL and security monitoring

*   Knowledge base and customer support

Just like most of the free web hosting providers, Wix places their own ads on free plan sites. You can only connect a Wix subdomain and would have to move to a paid plan for connecting a custom domain.

The eCommerce functionality is also unavailable in the free version, but you can still set up things like bookings, events, forums, and more with just a few clicks.

### 3. 000WebHost

![](https://mllj2j8xvfl0.i.optimole.com/Lsv2lkg.axYo~36f5d/w:713/h:286/q:98/https://s15165.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/000webhost-2.png)

[000WebHost](https://www.000webhost.com/)¬†is a free hosting option from¬†[Hostinger](https://themeisle.com/blog/go/hostinger/?source=ti-free-website-hosting). Some of its features include:

*   One website

*   No subdomains

*   300 MB disk space

*   3 GB of bandwidth

*   One MySQL database

*   Community forum, no live support

000WebHost comes with the¬†[Zyro website builder](https://themeisle.com/blog/go/zyro/?source=ti-free-website-hosting), which should make designing your site less intimidating. Like InfinityFree, visitors to your website won‚Äôt see ads, but there will be ads in your WordPress dashboard.

Free hosting from 000WebHost doesn‚Äôt even require a credit card to set up, and you can use it as long as you like. Also, if you outgrow your free plan, you can easily upgrade to a¬†[cheap plan from Hostinger](https://themeisle.com/blog/hostinger-review/). Hostinger plans start at¬†[$1.39 / month](https://themeisle.com/blog/go/hostinger/?source=ti-free-website-hosting)¬†for your first billing cycle.

[Google Cloud Hosting](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/web-hosting)¬†isn‚Äôt technically free. However, it does offer a one-year free trial that includes:

While Google Cloud Hosting is tailored towards large businesses, anyone can use it. To get started, all you need is a Google account.

The free trial lasts for 12 months or until you‚Äôve used up the $300 credit it includes. After this, you only pay for the resources you use. Google offers a¬†[price calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator)¬†to help you estimate your costs.
